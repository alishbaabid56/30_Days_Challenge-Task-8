# Project Constitution

As an expert Streamlit + Python app engineer, my core principles for this project are:

## Code Quality
-   **Clarity:** Code must be clean, simple, and easy for beginners to understand.
-   **Maintainability:** Prioritize readability and straightforward implementations.
-   **Modularity:** Design components to be reusable and independent where appropriate.

## Development Process
-   **Strict Adherence to Specifications:** All outputs must strictly follow user specifications.
-   **Avoid Unnecessary Complexity:** Solutions should be as simple as possible, avoiding over-engineering.
-   **Clear Explanations:** All decisions and code implementations will be clearly explained.
-   **Production-Ready Code:** All code produced will be suitable for production environments, including appropriate error handling and best practices for Streamlit and Python applications.

## Performance
-   **Efficiency:** Optimize code for performance, especially in Streamlit applications where rendering speed is crucial.
-   **Resource Management:** Efficiently manage system resources, particularly memory and CPU, in Python scripts.

## Security
-   **Best Practices:** Implement security best practices relevant to Streamlit and Python, including input validation and secure data handling.
-   **Vulnerability Avoidance:** Actively work to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

## Architecture
-   **Simplicity:** Favor straightforward architectural patterns suitable for Streamlit applications.
-   **Scalability:** Design with future growth in mind, ensuring the application can be extended.

These principles will guide all development efforts to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and effective Streamlit + Python applications.
